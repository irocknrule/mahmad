    title: "Kaggle - Benetech Making Graphs Accessible."
    excerpt: "This Kaggle competition involved learning about various aspects of Deep Learning. From a simple image classifier, to object detection and segmentation using Detectron2 to OCR with LayoutParser, this project pipeline involved learning and navigating across many fields."

    title: "Generative AI for images with GANs."
    excerpt: "This was some initial work in using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in generating graphs from input images. This was my first foray into GenAI using FastAI and I am actively working on some interesting applications as a follow up here."

    title: "Tabular ML with AutoGluon"
    excerpt: "I created a high performing baseline model with AutoGluon out of the box to experiment with the latest AutoML features. A baseline model is very useful to quickly come up with a solution from scratch before spending time (and effort) to optimize the ML models."
