Hello and welcome to this website. I am currently an Applied Scientist at Amazon with previous stops in AWS and Akamai, where I worked on various aspects of distributed systems and networking. 

From my days at grad school where I worked on Internet measurements to now where I am working on financial models, I have always worked with extremely large datasets of different varieties. From data about Internet architectures (based on ASNs), routing packets through Internet eXchange Points (IXPs), video QoE metrics data for the largest CDN in the world to forecasting networking rack growth in the world's largest datacenters at AWS - analyzing, slicing and dicing, viewing, modeling (whether statistical, ML or neural network) and associated tasks such as anomaly detection interests me significantly. In my current role, I explore using all these skills in the financial world of underwriting and credit systems. 

I am also interested in the world of theoretical computer science but could never delve into actual research. My interests there lie mainly in reading the state of the art research.

I am perpetually curious, so I like reading. I read books (fiction and non-fiction) and research papers (networking, theoretical CS and ML). I also realized that writing about what you learn helps re-inforce all the now learnings and concepts, so I decided to put my thoughts together in one central location.
