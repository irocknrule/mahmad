Visual Document Understanding (VDU) is a field with a wealth of research for which I had a use-case come up at work recently. There was a rather repetitive (and laborious) task of reading through a long PDF report with the same format for each customer, selecting some specific and pre-determined values from the PDF and copying them over to an excel spreadsheet. This would take 15-30 minutes of my time and my first thought was trying to automate the steps using LayoutParser and some OCR engine, but I found an easier solution with the DOcumeNt Uderstanding Transformer (DONUT) model [1]. The paper is very interesting and I plan on publishing a full review of the paper soon, but before that I want to write about my experiments with this OCR free approach. 

For this post, I will use some publicly available financial reports from the Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC) for the company Tesla, specifically the form 10-K which is a mandatory annual report that all publicly traded companies in the US are required to file. It provides a comprehensive summary of a company's financial performance and business activities. We will consider only a few select pages in this experiment. Full reports are available within the SEC's EDGAR database [2].
